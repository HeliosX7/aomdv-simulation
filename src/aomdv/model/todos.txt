some routes for origin are automatically deleted at time 28 when sending 50 packets at interval of 1.00s

after path expiration path is not deleted // FOR NOW NOT NEEDED ROUTE IS DELETED SO IT IS FINE IF PATH IS NOT DELETED

multiuple paths still not forming in many cases

Route lifetime functions is working fine but path->SetExpire function is not working neither Updatepathtime but actually 
we dont need that as we have to work on the latest energy and every path nees to be updated after some time

actually path expiratin work if we do the routeUpdate after that

after route expiry from valid , route doesnt get deleted but goed to down/invalid with a time period of 15s.

may have to increase route expiration time as when interval is set to 1s and we have 5 paths then it takes 5s but route expiration time max can be 4.2 s smthng

//a good rerr checking case can be wifi-energy-longRange with interval = 1s as RERR is produced but packet is not received afte that

in aomdv if rrep is received then the rrep is sent to the maximum hop available path for more paths

the problem im facing is called route cutoff problem

also load balancing faces interference problem

what we are doing here is even though when dest recieves rreq and it doesnt form a path due to disjointedness we are
sending a rrep along the sender neighbor, so what we can do is if we recieve a rreq at dest for which the first hop is
same and thus we cant form a path then we send the rrep to that sender neighbor and in the rrep record a field called first-hop
so when any intermediate node receives this rrep it knows that it cannot send its data through a path which has first-hop as 
the recorded value in rrep.

insertprecursor is not used in recvreply and thus most of the times it is empty

also when we are getting a rerr for a dest from a src we are deleting the whole route instead of a path (random -   uint32_t numPackets = 350;
  uint32_t numNodes = 100; // by default, 5x5
  uint32_t sinkNode = 32;
  uint32_t sourceNode = 2;
  double interval = 0.1; // seconds
  )

do load balanced at intermediate nodes as well if neccessary

multiple rreqs ale to make multiple paths in good numbers, things remain like when to start data sending and the
route is marked in_search and the lifetime of route is also less
